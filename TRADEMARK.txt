MOODLE TRADEMARKS POLICY
========================

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The word "Moodle" is trademarked in many countries around the world. The word
was originally coined as an acronym: Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning
Environment. The trademark is owned by Martin Dougiamas, Founder and Director
of Moodle.

The law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent the use of
confusingly similar names by third parties. Through this policy we’d like to
make it clear how Moodle-related projects, organisations, and people can use
the Moodle trademark. We’d also like to be clear about how use of the word is
restricted when used to promote commercial Moodle services. We do this to
protect the very business model that allows us to continue developing Moodle
for you.

Allowed uses
------------

The following uses don’t require any permission at all:

* Referring to the software or the Moodle project.
* Describing your own Moodle implementation (including within corporate
  settings).
* Describing a Moodle-based community hub.
* Describing some software you’ve made that integrates with Moodle
  (eg a Moodle integration feature on another system).

Restricted uses
---------------

The following uses are generally prohibited without explicit and direct
permission being granted to you by Moodle Pty Ltd. We do this to protect the
Moodle project from software and sites which could confuse people. Please
contact us to ask for permission in writing.

* You can’t use "Moodle" in the name of your software (including Mobile apps)
* You can’t use "Moodle" in your company name
* You can’t use "Moodle" in your domain name
* You can’t use "Moodle" in advertising-related keywords (such as Adsense)
* You can’t use "Moodle" to describe services around Moodle (such as hosting,
  training, support, consulting, course creation services, theme development,
  customisation, installation, integration and certification). This applies
  even if you do not charge for the services. Note that usually only Moodle
  Partners have this permission.

The Moodle Trademark
--------------------

The brand and word "Moodle" has trade mark protection in many countries around
the world. Various Moodle™ trade marks are owned by either Moodle Pty Ltd or
one of its associated entities. The law obligates trade mark owners to police
their trade marks and prevent the use of confusingly similar names by
third parties.

We have created a more concise and thorough set of Trademark Guidelines
(https://moodle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Moodle-Trademark-Guidelines-2023-4.pdf)
to help you understand how to comply with Moodle's trade mark requirements.
The Trademark Guidelines will also assist our Moodle Certified Partners and the
community to understand some of the principles that inform Moodle's stance
whenever potential infringement has been detected by us or our community.

We need to be clear about use of the word "Moodle" and how we restrict its use
when promoting commercial Moodle™ branded services. The proper use of
trade marks reliably assures consumers about the quality of the associated
products or services and where they have been derived from. Because the
Moodle LMS is made available under the open source ‘GNU General Public License'
that permits you to modify the copyrighted software, the distribution of such
modified software in combination with Moodle trade marks can potentially
mislead others in the community. To be clear, the GNU GPL does not include an
implied right or licence to use Moodle's trade marks.

We do all this to protect the very business model that allows us to continue
developing various Moodle software solutions for you.

Allowed uses of "Moodle"
------------------------

The following uses don't require any permission at all:

* Referring to the software or the Moodle project as the "Moodle™ software"
  or the "Moodle™ project"
* Describing your own implementation of the Moodle™ software platform
  (including within corporate settings).
* Describing a Moodle-based community hub.
* Describing certain software you've made that integrates with Moodle™
  branded software (e.g. a Moodle™ integration feature on another system).

Restricted uses of "Moodle"
---------------------------

The following uses are generally prohibited without explicit and direct
permission being granted to you by Moodle Pty Ltd. We do this to protect the
Moodle™ project from software and sites which could confuse people. If in
doubt, reach out for clarification at <trademarks@moodle.com>

  associated with Moodle HQ if you are not.
  This applies even if you do not charge for the services.
  Note that usually only Moodle Partners have this permission.
